## General guidelines for writing code

Whenever you are editing a file, follow these guidelines:

- keep the existing style of code in a given file
- drop colons and braces whenever possible
- don't put inner padding within JS objects: {..}
- if the instruction after `if`/`else`/`for` is short enough, write it on the same line
- start inline comments with lowercase letter, and block comments with a capital letter
- try to align the code and comments vertically where it makes sense
- don't remove commented code and keep the existing formatting when editing a file
- reuse existing utility functions
- use `abc_xyz` naming for variables and functions
- prefer `let` over `const` for local variables
- use `import` not `require`
