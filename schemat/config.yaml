# bootstrap_rings:
# Configuration of a temporary database from which the Site, the Cluster, and the main Database are loaded during startup.
# One of the rings should contain the target Site object together with its immediate dependencies (e.g., database).
# After the Site and its ultimate Database are loaded, the bootstrap database is discarded.
# Each bootstrap ring is read-only if not declared otherwise (`readonly: false`), but this declaration is temporary
# and only affects the bootstrap phase. The final configuration of rings is read from the ultimate database, and for
# this reason, the bootstrap database typically consists of just the kernel ring and the cluster/site configuration ring.
