  info: An agent that - depending on the settings - creates a shared Kafka client,
    a permanently-connected Kafka producer, and/or a Kafka consumer that
    forwards all incoming messages to the __consume__() method.
  schema:
    start_client:
      default: false
      info: If true, this agent starts a new KafkaJS client. Otherwise, the global
        schemat.node.kafka_client is used.
      "@": schemat/types/type.js:BOOLEAN
    start_producer:
      default: false
      info: If true, this agent starts a permanently-connected Kafka producer that can
        possibly be used by other objects running on the node. Typically, this
        is only used to create a shared singleton producer (one per node)
        managed by the Node instance.
      "@": schemat/types/type.js:BOOLEAN
    start_consumer:
      default: true
      info: If true, this agent starts a Kafka consumer that listens on a dedicated
        Kafka topic and forwards messages to the __consume__() method. This
        option should be `true` in majority of agents that subclass KafkaAgent
        (i.e., in any agent that processes incoming Kafka messages on its own),
        that is why its default value is true.
